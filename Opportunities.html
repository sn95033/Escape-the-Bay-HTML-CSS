                                <p>We analysed the employment opportunities by county in terms of the number of businesses in each county.
                                The number of California businesses has been stable year upon year, although we look forward to a data refresh in 2019-2020.
                                Unsurprisingly, there are fewer places of employment in Contra Costa, San Mateo counties, as these locations are more suburban.
                                
                                </p>

                                <p>The primary standout is Los Angeles County, which has significantly more businesses than all the other counties, both
                                    within and outside of California.  Los Angeles County has both a very diverse population as well has huge area, which naturally 
                                    would increase the total number of
                                    businesses.  LA County has diverse types of businesses, many of them unique to LA,  such as the entertainment industry including
                                    film, music, and theme parks. It has numerous educational institutions, government and private research firms in areas requiring capital intensive 
                                    manufacturing, such as aerospace.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Because of the wide diversity of enterprises in Los Angeles, quite a few of which can benefit from the growing field of data science.
                                    Additionally the diversity of employment is helpful for families so that both spouses may be able to find employment.

                            <p> Outside of California, the number of businesses appears to be stable and slightly growing year upon year.
                            We look forward to a data refresh in the 2020 census.
                            </p>

                            <p>Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is located, and New York have the largest number of employers in the top 5 non-CA destinations.
                            The diversity of jobs in these locations will also be a draw for 2-income households, as it will be easier for the second person to 
                            find an opportunity and diversity buffers the impact of economic downturns.
